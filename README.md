# myRepository
# This is my Data Analytics Capstone project, completed in February of 2023. The objective was simple: answer a business question. I wanted to
# use a financial-based dataset. I found my dataset on data.world (https://data.world/oklahoma/purchase-card-fiscal-year), 
# it is all the transactions made in 2014 using thestate's purchase card. The dataset has 442458 rows. This project was completed over the course of 5 weeks.
